    <p>
        An application for divorce can be completed in one step or two steps depending on
        how you are swearing / affirming your affidavit(s).
        The two steps include an initial filing and a final filing.
        The initial filing is where you will start the proceeding for divorce
        by filing your Notice of Joint Family Claim.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final filing is the application asking the court to order the divorce
        and includes your sworn / affirmed affidavit(s) and other supporting documents.
