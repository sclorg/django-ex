            You must apply for divorce in the Canadian province or territory in which you've lived for a full year immediately before making your application.<br>
            To find out how to apply for a divorce in your province or territory refer to the appropriate
            <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/pt-tp/index.html" target="_blank">Provincial or Territorial Government website.</a>

            <p>Yes. If you've been living in B.C. for at least one year and continue to live in B.C., you can apply for
                    divorce in BC Supreme Court. The Canada Divorce Act states that a provincial court can deal with a
                    divorce proceedings when either spouse has been living in the province for at least one year immediately
                    before applying.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="information-message bg-danger" id="divorce_precondition" hidden>
        <p>
            Before you can apply for divorce in B.C. it is required that you or your spouse has lived in B.C (ordinarily resident)
            for the last year. You can use this Divorce Service but you will not be able to submit your divorce application to
            the registry until you or your spouse has lived in the province for one year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another option is to see if you are eligible to apply for divorce in the province/ territory that
            you have most recently lived in prior to moving to B.C.<br>
