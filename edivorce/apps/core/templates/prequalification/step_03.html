    <p>Some divorces are more complicated than others, and not everyone should
    use this online tool. So let's start by asking you a few questions to make
    sure that this website is right for your situation.</p>

                <p><b>Living separate and apart</b></p>
                <p>You or your spouse have decided to end the marriage. In
                general one separates by moving out.  However, it is possible
                to be separated but still live under the same roof as long as
                either you or your spouse have clearly communicated  your
                intention for a permanent separation (and are starting to act
                upon it).</p>
                <p>This could mean:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>You're living in separate rooms</li>
                  <li>You're sleeping in separate beds</li>
                  <li>There's no sexual relationship</li>

            The date you entered indicates you've been separated for less than
            one year. You can use this online tool to start working on the
            divorce forms, however, you will not be able to file your documents
            at the registry until the one year separation period has passed.
        </p>

        <p>Under the Divorce Act, a divorce may be granted on one of three grounds:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>intentional separation for more than one year</li>
            <li>adultery</li>
            <li>physical or mental cruelty</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Most divorces are granted on the basis of intentional separation
            for more than a year.  It's possible to get a divorce more quickly
            by basing it on the grounds of either adultery or physical or
            mental cruelty.  However, you must be able to prove the adultery or
            cruelty. It's best to talk to a lawyer before deciding to seek a
            divorce on grounds other than separation.

<h3>Am I separated?</h3>

<p>When two people who have been living together in a marriage decide not to
live together any more, they are separated.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a "legal" separation. If you are living apart, you
are separated.</p>

<p>It is possible to be separated and still living in the same home where a
clear intention of a permanent separation has been communicated and acted
upon.</p>

<h3>What happens if my spouse and I tried to work things out?</h3>
<p>
    If you apply for a divorce on the basis of a one-year separation, you can
    live together for up to 90 days (either before or after you file the
    application) to try to reconcile. If things do not work out, you can
    continue your action for divorce as if you had not spent the time together.
</p>

<h3>Does being separated mean living at two different addresses?</h3>

<p>Some couples choose to separate but still live in the same house. A lawyer can tell you what factors courts may consider when they are deciding if you are separated.</p>

<p>A <a
  href="https://familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/howToProveYouAreSeparatedIfYouStillLiveTogether.php"
  target="_blank">list of activities and behaviours</a> that the courts
consider to be indicators of a couple being separated can be found on the
Family Law in B.C. website.</p>
